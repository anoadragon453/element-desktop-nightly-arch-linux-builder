# Element Desktop Nightly Arch Linux build script

A script that automatically downloads today's nightly release of Element
Desktop and installs it.

Makes use of the PKGBUILD from
[element-desktop-nightly-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/element-desktop-nightly-bin/).
This script was born out of the infrequency of updates of that package.

Run the following to automatically download and install the latest version of Element Desktop Nightly:

```
./update.sh
```
